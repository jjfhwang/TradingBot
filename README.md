# TradingBot

## Description

TradingBot is a robust and modular framework for building automated cryptocurrency trading bots in Go. It provides a flexible architecture for implementing custom trading strategies and connecting to various cryptocurrency exchanges. The framework is designed to be easily extensible and maintainable, allowing developers to rapidly prototype and deploy automated trading solutions. It aims to abstract away the complexities of interacting with exchange APIs, managing order execution, and handling market data, enabling users to focus on developing profitable trading algorithms.

## Features

*   **Modular Strategy Implementation:** The framework allows users to define trading strategies as independent modules, promoting code reusability and simplifying strategy development. Strategies can be easily swapped and combined to create complex trading systems.
*   **Exchange API Abstraction:** TradingBot provides a consistent interface for interacting with multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, shielding users from the specific details of each exchange's API. Currently supporting Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken (can be easily extended).
*   **Real-time Market Data Handling:** The framework efficiently handles real-time market data streams from exchanges, providing strategies with up-to-date information for decision-making. This includes price data, order book information, and trade history.
*   **Order Management System:** TradingBot provides a robust order management system that handles order placement, modification, and cancellation. It supports various order types, including market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders.
*   **Backtesting Capability:** The framework includes backtesting functionality, allowing users to evaluate the performance of their strategies on historical market data. This enables rigorous testing and optimization before deploying strategies to live trading.
